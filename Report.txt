Although this problem is a lot easier to solve with a Monte Carlo algorithm, it is not necessarily the most accurate, 
which is the reason why a degree of accuracy is required. If I were not using a Monte Carlo algorithm, I would first
calculate the volume of each individual rectangular prism. This would be easy to do with the given information, one would 
simply calculate the length, width, and height to multiply them together. This would provide an exact volume for each 
prism. From there, I would select a rectangular prism and go through the rest of the prisms and determine if there is any 
overlap between them, and the volume that is overlapping. I would go through every prism and check every other prism against
it in this fashion, and I would be able to calculate the total volume by subtractiung the overlapping volume for each prism. 
This would require a lot more complicated algorithms and would be difficult to logically implement. The Monte Carlo approach 
helps to avoid these pitfalls by providing a simple and elegant solution that is "close enough" for the vast majority of 
applications. Because the distribution of randomness becomes normal with a large enough sample, it is highly likely that with
the number of random points generated in this exercise that the distribution throughout the volume of the bounding box is 
normal and even, but it will also be dense due to the large sameple size. This means that the volume generated in this 
exercise will be very close, and is a lot simpler to implement and understand than a precise solution.
